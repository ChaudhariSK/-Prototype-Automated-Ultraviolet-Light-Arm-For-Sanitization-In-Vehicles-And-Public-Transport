# Prototype-Automated-Ultraviolet-Light-Arm-For-Sanitization-In-Vehicles-And-Public-Transport
Sanitization is an important thing in our life,  as we know COVID-19 is spread through getting in contact with a  contaminated surface, To prevent such spread of viruses we have to sanitize the surfaces that people get in contact with throughout the day, but the areas like interior of cars and public transport are difficult to sanitize and costly as well.  So we required low cost and effective system for the sanitization of such areas in Taxy, Cars, Buses and Train. Ultraviolet-C rays(200-280nm) can potentially kill 99.99% of COVID-19  Viruses, so we have considered FAR UVC(207-222nm) light for our sanitization process, that do not harm the exposed human tissues. we have decided to build an automated 360-degree rotating arm containing two or more Ultraviolet sources and a camera, we can see the whole sanitization process going inside through that camera the system can be fitted with one to supported by clamps one is for roof and the other is for the bottom we can increase and decrease the size of the rod and the arm as per the height and width of the vehicle we are providing low-cost shield maid with m aluminium foil and other UV rays diluting layers to prevent the UVC light to leak outside as well as it can block outer light to enter inside the vehicle.
